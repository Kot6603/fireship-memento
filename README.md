## Memory Game
*Note*: This was created by following a tutorial from a React course at Fireship.io

### Description
The game starts with a 4x4 tile with two cards of each image.
You try to match the two cards and the game will end once all the images have been matched.
There is a win streak counter at the top to track your progress

### Tech Stack
